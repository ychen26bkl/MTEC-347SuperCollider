# MTEC-347 Analysis

##### by Yujin Chen

### 1. What you did?
I did the research on a piece called "johchow" from artist Luka Prin훾i훾's three SC piece EP "ilex". It's a FM synth piece inspried and tribute to John Chowning. 

The slides are [here](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGAlq6T27o/05fv4id1DzYY9MEvlZsEoA/edit?utm_content=DAGAlq6T27o&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton).

### 2. How you did it

From the [SuperCollider Message Board](https://scsynth.org/), I found a music sharing link for this EP - [here](https://lukaprincic.bandcamp.com/album/ilex). It just catches me for the nice use of FM synth and how elegant the codes are composed. 

I carefully listened to the piece and was inspired by how Luka Prin훾i훾 structually compsed and organized the sound design and music evelution. 

More analysis for each moudles and the piece advantages summaries are layered in the canva presenattion slides.

### 3. The problems you faced

Not for exact faced problems, but I learned a lot about how to organize codes and deconstruct for complex pieces. 

### 4. Referenced codes
